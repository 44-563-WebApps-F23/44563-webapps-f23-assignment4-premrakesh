<p class="speech">Just now.</p> 
<p class="direction">[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her
mouth.]_</p> <p>Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p>

<h5 class="helmer">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Don’t disturb me.</p>
<p class="direction"> _[A little later, he opens the door and looks into
the room, pen in hand.]_ </p>
<p class="speech">Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my
little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p>

<h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p>

<h5 class="helmer">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>

<h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
of money.</p>

<h5 class="helmer">HELMER.</h5>
<p class="speech">Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
salary is due.</p>

<h5 class="nora">NORA.</h5>
<p class="speech">Pooh! we can borrow until then.</p>
